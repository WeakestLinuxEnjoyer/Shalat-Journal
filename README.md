# Shalat-Journal
This repository explains how to journal your _shalat_ (Islamic obligatory prayer).

## Background
_Shalat_ is an Islamic obligatory prayer performed five times in a day, they are _Shubuh_, _Dzuhur_, _Ashar_, _Maghrib_, _Isya_. Despite its importance, _shalat_ is often forgotten or alternatively, _shalat_ is committed but we are unaware of it. _Shalat_ journal is an attempt to journal _shalat_ so that muslims can hold their _shalat_ accountable. 

Keep in mind, this journal is meant for *personal use* for the sake of self-development. It's not meant to be show off but as a practice of self-honesty.

## Scope 
_Shalat_ journal tracks five elements : 

1. Date : The date of shalat committed in YYYY/MM/DD format.
2. Shalat : The five obligatory prayers, _Shubuh_, _Dzuhur_, _Ashar_, _Maghrib_, _Isya_.
3. Commitment :
   - Committed : If the shalat is committed.
   - Abandoned : If the shalat is abandoned.
4. Person :
   - Jamaah : If the prayer is performed in congregation (_Jamaah_).
   - Alone : If the prayer is performed alone.
5. Place :
   - Mosque : If the prayer is performed in a mosque (_masjid_), a place designated for worship (_ibadah_). If a mosque is unreachable or unavailable, _mushalla_ is permitted.
   - Home : If the prayer is performed at home.

The journal should look like this :
